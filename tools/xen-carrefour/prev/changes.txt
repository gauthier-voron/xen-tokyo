Makefile:
- remove libgsl
- remove libnuma

carrefour.h:
- remove <numa.h>

carrefour.c:
- quoted <gsl/gsl_statistics.h>
- new include <xencarrefour.h>
- replace syscall(__NR_perf_counter_open) by xen_open_hw()
  -> 6 counters per cpu -- multiplexing ?
- replace read() on perfcnt by xen_read_hw()
- replace sysinfo() by musage() to obtain memory usage

xencarrefour.{h,c}:
- implement minimal set of libnuma
- temp implement libgsl
- implement naive and brutal multiplexing for perfctr
  -> multiplexing is done by a separated thread changing perctrs every 250ms
- implement memory usage command musage()


carrefour_main.c:
- carrefour_init_module() and carrefour_exit_module() are now normal functions
  reached by hypercalls
- ibs_proc_write() is no more a VFS function and is reached by hypercall
- all VFS related function has been removed

carrefour_rbtree.c:
- change stats from double to unsigned long (no SSE available)

ibs_main.c:
- replace for_each_possible_cpu() by for_each_online_cpu()
- in the handling of ibs samples:
  - change kernel_mode by hypervisor_mode
  - change tgid by domain_id
  - change pid by vcpu_id
